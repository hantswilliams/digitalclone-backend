# Ideas 
- since AWS lambda does not have GPU capability YET, idea is can have a single or set of EC2 instances that are properly configured with SSL, domain name, etc...that can be turned on and off when need to execute commands

## Examples
- the start/stop.py files here are from: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/start-stop-lambda-eventbridge/ 
- the checkStatus.py file from: https://www.edureka.co/community/65871/how-check-instance-state-and-status-via-lambda-function-aws
